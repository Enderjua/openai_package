# üü¢ Usage

## Authentication

### API key

The OpenAI API utilizes API keys for authentication. You can obtain your account's API key by visiting the[API keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) section of your account.

```dart
import 'package:openai_package/openai_package.dart';
import 'package:openai_package/src/openai/import/importAi.dart'; //  you must add

// lib/main.dart
void main() {
  OpenAI.apiKey = 'your-api-key';
  // ..
}
```

If there is no `apiKey` data provided, you will be prompted with a warning message to enter your `apiKey` data.

If you have an `apiKey` but it has expired or is invalid, you will receive an error message as the output from the OpenAI APIs

If there is no `model` specified, you will be prompted with a warning message to select your preferred model.

If you have specified a `model` but it is invalid or not supported, you will receive an error message indicating the issue


## Setting an organization

If you want to configure an `organization` when using the OpenAI API, you can use the following code snippet:

```dart
// Enter the user's organization ID
OpenAI.organization = 'org-HZ3hl5Z89fEYVUufQOCzunok';
```




[Learn More From Here.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication)

## Settings a default request timeout

This library utilizes the `http` package for API requests, which comes with a default 30-second timeout. Any request exceeding this duration is canceled and throws an exception. To avoid unexpected cancellations, you can configure a custom default timeout:

```dart
// Set the default request timeout to 60 seconds (adjust as needed)
OpenAI.connectionTimeout = Duration(seconds: 60);
```

With this, your API calls will now wait up to 60 seconds for a response before raising an exception, allowing more breathing room for potentially slower `requests`.

### Key Points:
- Adjustable timeout: Set the desired response time using OpenAI.requestsTimeout.
- Duration format: Use the Duration class to specify the timeout in seconds (e.g., Duration(seconds: 45))
- Improved flexibility: Avoid unwanted cancellations for longer-running requests.

### Caution:
- Be mindful of exceeding reasonable timeouts, as it can significantly impact performance and responsiveness.
- Adjust the timeout value based on your specific use case and expected response times.

### Additional Notes:
- Consider implementing custom timeout logic for individual requests if needed.
- Monitor and manage performance implications of increased timeout values.


## Chat (GPT)

### Create chat completion

Provides a predicted completion for a chat message(s) based on the provided properties:


if your want used to `old` version:

```dart
  MessageData result = await openAI.chat(version: 'old', prompt: 'hello world!');
  print(result.message);


```

and if your want used `new` version:
```dart
/// This code snippet demonstrates how to use the `openAI` package to perform a chat-based conversation.
/// It creates a list of messages, where each message has a role (system or user) and content.
/// The `openAI.chat` method is then called with the list of messages to initiate the chat.
/// The result of the chat is printed, and then the response is formatted using the `FormatMessage` class.
/// The formatted response is printed as well.


 List<Message> message = [
    Message(role: 'system', content: 'you are my help ai'),
    Message(role: 'user', content: 'I need help with my computer'),
  ];
  

  MessageData result = await openAI.chat(messages: message);
  print(result.message);

  // if you want printing other information:
  print(result.model);

```

The `chat` method is used to interact with the OpenAI API for generating conversational responses. It takes various parameters to customize the behavior of the conversation.

### Parameters

- `version`: Specifies the version of the OpenAI API to use. Defaults to 'new'.
- `messages`: A list of previous messages in the conversation. Each message should be an instance of the `Message` class.
- `prompt`: The initial prompt to start the conversation.
- `maxTokens`: The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response. Defaults to 100.
- `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the response. Higher values lead to more randomness. Defaults to 0.3.
- `topP`: Controls the diversity of the response by sampling from the topP tokens. Defaults to 1.0.
- `n`: Specifies the number of responses to generate. Defaults to 1.
- `frequencyPenalty`: Applies a penalty to the frequency of tokens in the response. Defaults to 0.
- `logitBias`: A dictionary specifying logit biases for tokens.
- `logprobs`: Whether to include log probabilities in the response.
- `topLogprobs`: Specifies the number of log probabilities to include in the response.
- `presencePenalty`: Applies a penalty to the presence of tokens in the response.
- `responseFormat`: Specifies the format of the response. Can be 'json' or 'text'.
- `seed`: A seed value for generating random responses.
- `stop`: Specifies conditions to stop generating tokens.
- `stream`: Whether to stream responses as they are generated.
- `speed`: Controls the speed of the response generation.

  ### Usage Example

```dart
import 'package:openai_package/openai_package.dart';
import 'package:openai_package/src/openai/import/importAi.dart'; //  you must add

void main() {
  // Initialize OpenAI instance
  OpenAI.apiKey = 'your-api-key';

  // Define previous messages
  List<Message> messages = [
    Message(role: 'system', content: 'Hello, how can I assist you today?')
  ];

  OpenAI openAi = OpenAI();

  // Generate response
  Future<MessageData> response = openAi.chat(
    messages: messages,
    // for old version prompt: 'I need help with a programming problem.',
    maxTokens: 150,
    temperature: 0.7,
    n: 1,
    stream: false,  
  );
  print(response.toString());
}
```


## üöÄ OpenAI Embeddings
